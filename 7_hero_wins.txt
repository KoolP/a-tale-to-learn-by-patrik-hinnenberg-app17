The spider gets closer but they manage to escape from the misty woods.
Lil Dragon drops the farmer besides his old motorcyckle and the farmer starts to kick the bike running.
Lil dragon draws the blowtoarch and turns facing the spider.
The farmer gets the bike running and speeds away.
Now Lil'Dragon stands faced to a 5 meter tall grounting spider.
The spiders head reminds of Rupert the ugly.
As the spider screams and gets ready to attack Lil'Dragon loads her torchgun.
Lil'Dragon jumps back and fires the tourch in mid air so the jumping spiders head blows.
